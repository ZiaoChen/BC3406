CALM SENSITIVE CLEANSER (NORMAL / DRY),3,PACKAGING CAN BE IMPROVED,"Like the other review here, packaging should be changed because the products leak once it is opened.

This is a good, gentle cleanser but cannot be relied on to remove makeup. Also, i feel that it is a little pore clogging so more time should be spent when rinsing the product off. Find that it cleans much better when applied on dry skin and rubbed for a few minutes before adding water to lather it up."
CALM SENSITIVE CLEANSER (NORMAL / DRY),3,NICE PRODUCT BUT PACKAGING NOT SO GOOD FOR TRAVELLING,"I did like this product, from the little amount that was left in the bottle after I opened my toiletry bag and found it had leaked everywhere! It was brand new! Luckily I managed to salvage a small amount and liked the product, hence buying again to try it out again.

Warning: The bottle leaks when it is laid on its side so not good for travelling. Best to empty into travel size bottles to avoid wastage."
HYDRALIGHT ONE STEP FACE CLEANSER,4,RECOMMENDED!,My go to for extra oily days - I have combination skin.
HYDRALIGHT ONE STEP FACE CLEANSER,5,LOVE IT,"I have a combination skin. And I've used so many cleansers over the years and always had to switch. My surface skin dries out no matter how mild the cleanser is and causes clogged pores. This cleanser however does a good job of cleaning my skin without drying it out as much. Only issue is that with a combiation skin, my forehead and cheeks continue to get oily faster. I just use a clay mask on these areas once a week to clear hen abit more throughly while keeping the other areas away from too deep a cleanse. Love this product overall."
PERFECT CLEANSING OIL,2,BROKE ME OUT,"I am always on the look out for a cleansing oil of good value. Be sure to check the ingredient list. Unfortunately it broke me out, so I used the rest of the product to wash my make up brushes."
PERFECT CLEANSING OIL,3,GOOD MAKEUP REMOVER,Fragrance free and a blend of great oils. However all of it gets washed off if you second cleanse so cant recommend the high price.
SKIN BALANCING OIL-REDUCING CLEANSER,5,PERFECT FOR OILY SKIN,I love this cleanser. I use in the morning and night. It clean my skin without drying it out or making it feel tight and stretched.
SKIN BALANCING OIL-REDUCING CLEANSER,5,GREAT VALUE AND WORKS WELL TO REMOVE DIRT & MAKEUP!,"I buy the extra large bottle of this, it lasts for ages and works really well to remove oil (I live in the tropics), and makeup. Really great value product that I would recommend to folks with oily skin."
SKIN BALANCING OIL-REDUCING CLEANSER,5,CLEANSER OF CHOICE,"My night time cleanser, removes make up/sunscreen and fragance free been using this for years. I always get the big bottle lasts for ages and good value for money. Doesnt irritate or strip skin."
SKIN BALANCING OIL-REDUCING CLEANSER,4,EFFECTIVE CLEANSER,"Cleanse effectively without dehydration.

Good combination with it's toner."
SKIN BALANCING OIL-REDUCING CLEANSER,5,VALUE FOR MONEY,"Not overly drying, leaving skin feeling clean and well balanced"
CALM SENSITIVE TONER (NORMAL / DRY),5,DOES WHAT IT CLAIMS,I used to get the occasional random red patches on my face as I've got sensitive skin. This got rid of the redness entirely and has been a constant in my skincare routine since.
SKIN RECOVERY ENRICHED CALMING TONER,5,GREAT CALMING TONER,"I have got really dry skin most of the time which acts up a week before my period. This toner is not only non irritating to my sensitive skin but helps to calm it down, giving a clean surface before my next few steps (serum.. moisturiser)!"
SKIN RECOVERY ENRICHED CALMING TONER,4,REVIEW,Has been using this toner for a while and it helps to remove leftover dirts after facial cleansing
CALM SENSITIVE 1% BHA LOTION,5,GENTLE BUT EFFECTIVE!,"This did not irritate my highly sensitive skin but made it clearer and kept clogged pores at bay. I started with this nightly, and then now I rotate it with the 2% lotion. I will definitely repurchase."
CALM SENSITIVE 1% BHA LOTION,5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,Effective keeping at bay PMS related breakouts - I use it every night under moisturiser.
CALM SENSITIVE 1% BHA LOTION,3,GOOD FOR SENSITIVE SKINS,"I have tried this, it works fine and it is a gentle exfoliant. As to reduce redness, I saw a bit of difference but not too much. Overall, I think this would suit very sensitive skin types."
CALM SENSITIVE 1% BHA LOTION,5,AMAZING,"Love the formula and the texture of this products

I was traveling in Europe for a month and this kept my skin problem free and also calms my skin down !"
CALM SENSITIVE 1% BHA LOTION,1,DOES NO DIFFERENCE AS COMPARED TO SKIN PERFECTING 1% BHA LOTION EXFOLIANT,"I was previously using the Skin Perfecting 1% BHA Lotion Exfoliant before this calm series was released as a better version.
There is no positive outcome from using this product, and it is unfortunate that the Skin Perfecting 1% BHA Lotion Exfoliant has been replaced by this."
RESIST ADVANCED PORE-REFINING TREATMENT 4% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),5,"A MIRACLE PRODUCT FOR OILY, BLEMISH-PRONE SKIN!","I'm a big fan of the 2% BHA lotion but this product is fantastic as a 3-times weekly exfoliator, or when I have a breakout (then daily). I have super oily skin but this is still too drying if I use it everyday. To clear a breakout, I use this at night, and then gently cleanse my skin with a wet cloth"
RESIST DAILY SMOOTHING TREATMENT 5% AHA (GLYCOLIC ACID),4,LIKING IT,"This is my first try with Paula's Choice skin care product. Was recommended to try this exfoliant as I have fine lines, uneven skin tone and slight pigmentation. When first applied, there's a slight itchy and bitey feeling on the skin. It's not unbearable, just makes me want to scratch it a little. Except for the slight fishy smell, I like the product and after a week's application, my skin does appear a little brighter and more even."
RESIST DAILY SMOOTHING TREATMENT 5% AHA (GLYCOLIC ACID),5,RADIANT COMPLEXION,"Is my first try on exfoliant . I like it improves my skin radiant, and smoother my skin"
SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID) LOTION,4,GREAT EXFOLLIATOR,"i love this lotion instead of liquid, this lotion more moisture."
RESIST 10% NIACINAMIDE BOOSTER,4,GOOD PRODUCT,"I used it once in a while on my super sensitive skin, as I was already using the PC 2% BHA twice a day and 1% retinol on my skin every night after building up a tolerance. I didn’t see any results on my skin but it is due to my inconsistent use. I used it on my 3 months old scar on my chest and it seems to have lighten it! So I think it is a great product if you can tolerate frequent consistent use."
RESIST 10% NIACINAMIDE BOOSTER,4,I LIKED THIS,I use this on clean skin before sunscreen every morning. I like that it feels like nothing and doesn’t weigh my skin down. It feels like my pores on my cheeks have shrunk as well.
RESIST 10% NIACINAMIDE BOOSTER,1,NO RESULTS,"Maybe I'm too impatient, but I didn't really notice any changes in my skin after using a full bottle so not something I'll repurchase."
RESIST 10% NIACINAMIDE BOOSTER,4,GREAT FOR BREAKOUT PRONE SKIN AND FADING SCARS,I have always loved the benefits of niacinamide and bought this soon after it was available and I am very happy to say that it does what it claims! Very lightweight but only thing I wished was that it came in a bigger size because I use it as a standalone product and not as a booster. Overall highly recommended!
RESIST 10% NIACINAMIDE BOOSTER,5,FOOD FOR MY SKIN....,Initially used this twice a day but now only at night as it is more tolerable to my skin. It is definitely good food for my skin as it evens out the skintone and takes away the dullness. Lightweight & quick absorption even when mixed with other serum. Highly recommended! Thanks PC!
RESIST ULTRA-LIGHT SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH HYALURONIC ACID,4,GREAT FOR HOT SUMMER DAYS,"I love the consistency and how supplied my skin felt once i applied this serum, can even go without another layer of moisturizer at night in hot summer days, one of the simple yet effective serums I love love love!"
RESIST ULTRA-LIGHT SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH HYALURONIC ACID,3,DIDN’T WORK FOR MY SKIN,"The texture felt silicony, and this broke me out. I didn’t like it at all. So I returned it. Paula’s Choice customer service was awesome and I used the store credits to buy something that worked for me"
RESIST ULTRA-LIGHT SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH HYALURONIC ACID,4,LIGHT ENOUGH FOR DAY TIME,I liked this as it was very light. However it felt a little silicone-y under my sunscreen and foundation. Would prefer something even lighter for day time.
RESIST ULTRA-LIGHT SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH HYALURONIC ACID,4,NICE TEXTURE,Lovely texture and certainly helps moisturise my oil skin. But it's an extra step I'd rather skip from my regime
RESIST ULTRA-LIGHT SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH HYALURONIC ACID,5,THE BEST OVERALL SERUM,Rebought this too many times to count. Makes my skin silky smooth with no breakouts. I love Paula's Choice!
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,3,ABIT STRONG,"Be careful when using, slightly strong for sensitive skin"
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,4,HMM,"Love-hate relationship with this. It takes some time for it to be fully absorbed after application. It also makes my skin feels very tight after. However, it did calm my breakouts very well along with the rest of the products."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,2,DIDNT WORK,"increased breakouts, prefer the drugstore version for regular use."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,5,THIS ALWAYS WORKS! MY HOLY GRAIL FOR PIMPS,"This always works on my zits, red bumps or those with heads. Usually, after applying after once or twice on headless red bump, the whitehead will be ripen and it is ready for extraction. Do note that this can may dry peeling skin (if you apply too frequent) so may sure you apply moisturiser or serum on that area before you apply this. Just a dab of this will do and remember to apply sunscreen if you are using in the day."
RESIST 25% VITAMIN C SPOT TREATMENT,2,SINCE THE,"C15 vitamin C didn't work for my brown spot, I thought a higher concentration would help, despite the rather crazy price tag for the size.
Sadly, still, I went through nearly two tubes of this, and it did not help at all. I also do not like the white cast it leaves unless I rub the product in, but the instructions say not to rub, so...
However, it does work for other people it seems. Therefore, 3 stars."
RESIST 25% VITAMIN C SPOT TREATMENT,4,UNSURE,"brightening- 100%
fade pimple/acne scars - 100%
dark spot - not yet. am on my first tube. maybe need prolonged usage for spots to fade."
RESIST 25% VITAMIN C SPOT TREATMENT,5,ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE !,It was such an amazing surprise to see how brightened and cleared the applied area and it required just a drop on jaw line
RESIST 25% VITAMIN C SPOT TREATMENT,2,IT STING,"Does not suitable to apply on healing scar as it really sting. However, does not see any result on me."
RESIST 25% VITAMIN C SPOT TREATMENT,4,BRIGHTENING,Helped brighten some stubborn spots over 3months but you need to be consistent with sunscreen. Heavy silicone based treatment so you really only need to tap a small amount over. Doesnt sit undermakeup well will pill if you rub so used at night. Helps control oils if used in am without makeup
CLINICAL CERAMIDE-ENRICHED FIRMING MOISTURIZER,4,GOOD SO FAR!,"I've only started using this a few weeks ago but so far so good on my oily, blemish-prone skin! My skin is both oily and dry, which is a pain. I need a night moisturizer that will protect my skin from air conditioning, moisturises, without breaking me out. So far this ticks all the boxes and feels lovely on the skin. My only question mark is that it feels slightly tingly when applying after the BHA 2% lotion, so this may not be good in the long term. But overall good product so far!"
CLINICAL CERAMIDE-ENRICHED FIRMING MOISTURIZER,5,"ABOUT AS THICK AS THE HYDRATOR, VERY MOISTURIZING","This moisturizer is about as thick as the Hydrator, and quite moisturizing. I have normal to combination skin - this one works very well for me. Doesn't clog and some nights i do not use the hyaluronic acid at all. Love it!"
SKIN RECOVERY REPLENISHING MOISTURIZER,5,CREAMY PM MOISTURISER,Soothes my extremely dry skin without irritation. I love how it makes my skin feel hydrated. I’m on my third bottle now!
SKIN RECOVERY REPLENISHING MOISTURIZER,4,DOES WHAT IT SAYS,"I have extremely sensitive skin and this does not irritate at all, so this is worthy of a try.

However, it is one star short because i find the formula a little on the thin side so when i have extremely dry and flaky skin due to allergies/reactions, slathering this on is still not enough."
SKIN RECOVERY REPLENISHING MOISTURIZER,5,GREAT FOR DRY SKIN,"I’ve been using this for about a month. I use only at night as its too rich for daytime. I have combination skin and i use this at night. Even with airconditioning on all night, the dry areas on my face feels soft the next morning. Will buy again."
RESIST ANTI-AGING CLEAR SKIN HYDRATOR,4,GOOD MOISTURIZER,I like the matte feel but expect more antioxidants.
RESIST ANTI-AGING CLEAR SKIN HYDRATOR,5,MY FAVOURITE MOISTURISER,"I love this! It provides great moisture and smooth skin without breaking me out. However, it's a little thick - try it first if you don't like the feeling of silicone."
RESIST ANTI-AGING CLEAR SKIN HYDRATOR,3,"SLIGHTLY DRYING, EVEN FOR OILY SKIN","I found this moisturiser to be quite drying, even though I have oily skin, and this is under the oily skin range. Changed to the barrier repair moisturiser and never looked back ;)"
RESIST ANTI-AGING CLEAR SKIN HYDRATOR,1,GAVE ME CYSTIC ACNE,Tried it first time. Gave me pimples. After a few weeks. I gave it a try again and I had cystic acne on my cheek. I have oily and acne prone. Disappointed
RESIST ANTI-AGING CLEAR SKIN HYDRATOR,2,PACKAGING CAN BE IMPROVED,"didnt like the pump packaging as it was hard to dispense the product. also did not work for me, my skin broke out a little."
CALM SENSITIVE DAYTIME MOISTURIZER SPF 30 (NORMAL / DRY),4,DOES WHAT IT SAYS,I got sample sizes from a friend and this actually works wonders. Gives a matte finish and good for under make up
CALM SENSITIVE DAYTIME MOISTURIZER SPF 30 (NORMAL / DRY),3,GOOD,Good
HYDRALIGHT SHINE FREE MINERAL COMPLEX SPF 30,3,NOT PERSPIRATION PROOF,"A light lotion consistency, comfortable for my combination skin. However, it does give a small amount of white case, but not too bad. Mineral spf is my preferred spf active, so i’m fine with the tiny bit of white cast.

The main issue i have with this is, it doesn’t stay on if i perspire."
HYDRALIGHT SHINE FREE MINERAL COMPLEX SPF 30,3,NOT REPURCHASING,"Sorry, still too oily to wear alone for my combination skin. Was OK under makeup though."
PC4MEN DAYTIME PROTECT SPF 30,5,RECOMMENDING,"This product did what it said. Using it for 2 years now and still loving it. FYI, 60ml is good for 4-5 months if used daily."
PC4MEN DAYTIME PROTECT SPF 30,4,GOOD OIL CONTROL AND LIGHT,Bought the 15ml bottle and gave it a shot. Impressed by the oil control and lightness of the sunscreen where most of the sunscreen I tried either gave you a white cast or is so oily/shiny after application and onto the day. WIll definitely buy again soon.
EXTRA CARE NON-GREASY SUNSCREEN SPF 50,5,LIGHT AND NON GREASY,Great protection without that greasy feeling.
EXTRA CARE NON-GREASY SUNSCREEN SPF 50,5,A GREAT EVERYDAY SUN-BLOCK IF YOU WORK OUTDOORS!,"This is the only sunblock I've used that never makes me break out! Its super breathable and non greasy, and the texture is similar to a light moisturizer- great for sensitive skin. It also works well under make up, and helps the foundation last longer. You get A LOT of sunscreen for a good price; the tube lasts me for 6-8 months of daily usage! I rarely ever go out without this sunblock; its a staple product in my morning regimen, and I'm loving it!"
EXTRA CARE NON-GREASY SUNSCREEN SPF 50,4,GOOD SUNBLOCK,Non greasy. Good for outdoor.
EXTRA CARE NON-GREASY SUNSCREEN SPF 50,4,GOOD FOR OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES,"used for my trip to a beach destination, its non-greasy and good for oily skin.

Cost effective, lasted a long time"
REHYDRATING MOISTURE MASK,4,GREAT MOISTURISING MASK!,I have oily skin that gets dry with air-conditioning and with regular blemishes. This works well as a 15-minutes moisture mask when I want my skin to look super smooth before doing my makeup.
SKIN RECOVERY HYDRATING TREATMENT MASK,5,THE BEST MOISTURISING MASK (PRE-MAKEUP AND WHEN FLYING),"I have oily skin that gets dry with air-conditioning and with regular blemishes. I wouldn't do a long haul flight without this on, it's invisible but keeps the skin plumped and sheltered from the nasty dry air in planes. I also use it as a 15mins mask before doing my makeup. Highly highly recommended."
SKIN RECOVERY HYDRATING TREATMENT MASK,4,GOOD VALUE,"This works as well, if not better than any much more expensive options in the market. Just adjust the amount and time you leave it one for your skin type. A bonus: it smells nice!"
SKIN RECOVERY HYDRATING TREATMENT MASK,3,DRY SKIN,"I am in my late 30s and have very dry skin. The mask is ok (yet to see any positive effect) for me to put on my face for 20minutes, but definitely not overnight. Left it overnight once, and maybe it was too rich? There were 2 red pimples which popped out the next day."
SKIN RECOVERY HYDRATING TREATMENT MASK,5,HOLY GRAIL MASK!!,"My go-to product when I feel that my skin needs a bit extra care after a long day in the sun or cold weather, I use it as a leave on mask/moisturizer, and I never failed to notice the glow coming back the next morning, will always have a bottle standby at home."
RESIST ANTI-AGING EYE CREAM,3,NO DIFFERENCE,The ingredients look amazing. But I didn’t see a difference to my eye area after using it religiously for 2 months day and night. Fine lines are still there. Good thing it didn’t give me milia seeds nor made my eyes puffy in the morning. I will continue using it as there is a lot left in the tube. Not sure if I will repurchase though.
RESIST ANTI-AGING EYE CREAM,5,GREAT EYE CREAM!,"I'm in my early 30s and start ed using this as soon as I started to see lines this year! Overall, great product, rich but doesn;t break the skin and I don't wake-up with super puffy eyes (which often happens to me with eye creams, strangely). I live in the tropics so sleep with airconditioning, which can be drying to the skin. I wake up really looking refreshed and the eye area much softer."
RESIST ANTI-AGING EYE CREAM,4,GREAT FOR FINE LINES,I apply this only at night. It is not as greasy as I thought it would be. Some effects on fine lines and puffiness can be seen just after a week. Good product!
RESIST ANTI-AGING EYE CREAM,4,GREAT TEXTURE AND WORKS WELL WITH MAKE UP,Many eye creams outside are too rich and causes milia seeds. This is a great eye cream which moisturises without bring too rich or thick. It also works very well under makeup.
RESIST ANTI-AGING EYE CREAM,4,ANTI-AGEING CREAM WORKS TOTALLY,I borrowed this product from my friend and I found that this product is really good! The Shea Butter and Peptides in the product makes it irresistibly to keep you from having wrinkles!
LIP & BODY TREATMENT BALM,2,DUD AND OVERPRICED LIP BALM,"One of the rare Paula's Choice items that didn't work for me. Not any better than cheap lip balms out there and the jar packaging is hypocritical since Paula always disses skincare that comes in a jar, saying it loses effectiveness once exposed to air."
LIP & BODY TREATMENT BALM,5,HOLYGRAIL LIPBLAM FOR NIGHT TIME USE!,This little pot helps with my lips staying hydrated every evening before I sleep. It helps to heal whatever dryness I have due to me being a smoker.
LIP & BODY TREATMENT BALM,4,AWESOME LIP BALM,my lips love this lip balm... just wish it has a more portable version!
LIP & BODY TREATMENT BALM,4,WORKS WELL,Saves my lips from those dry times. Works well. This could be better if its in a tube packaging so i can carry it with me.
LIPSCREEN SPF 50,3,GOOD BASIC LIPBALM,"Good basic lipbalm with spf. I bought this for the spf protection. I may have a bad one because the cap is quite stiff and hard to remove and halfway through, the tube of balm fell out a few times."
ALL OVER HAIR & BODY SHAMPOO,3,"SADLY,","I think Paula Choice is really an expert brand in terms of skin care, but not so much for hair care. This shampoo is a very simple shampoo which washes well, and honestly, just like any other normal shampoo out there. I do like that it is not greasy and not too drying as well. Still, there are plenty of shampoo products out there with a much cheaper price tag and which works as well."
ALL OVER HAIR & BODY SHAMPOO,4,FUNCTIONAL,Works for my dry hair. A life saver for overseas travel.
ALL OVER HAIR & BODY SHAMPOO,5,MY FAVORITE!!!,I’ve been struggling to find a fragrance free shampoo for ages! Thank goodness for Paula’s Choice! This shampoo/body wash cleanses my scalp brilliantly without stripping my hair. Its also a great body wash because its a product made with such a clean formula. I’ve stocked up since i discovered this :)
ALL OVER HAIR & BODY SHAMPOO,5,FANTASTIC SHAMPOO FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,"I’ve used 2 bottles and have 3 backups. That how much i love this. It works wonderfully as a shampoo and body wash. It doesn’t dry my hair and dry skin, feels very clean after. This is a very clean formula, i love it. The only con is the price, this stuff is quite expensive but i will continue to use it."
PC4MEN BODY WASH,5,GOOD PRODUCT.,I am using this as my daily shampoo. Agree that some may not like as it's scentless. But it's really good. Not sure why but my scalp was very itchy previously... I've tried many other shampoo.. even organic shampoo but still the itch persist. I switch to use this PC4Men and I realised recently that my scalp isn't itchy anymore. Will buy my second bottle soon.
CLEAR ACNE BODY SPRAY 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),4,USED TO BE GOOD BUT,"recently, the few bottles which I received smelled different and feels different I feel like the thing has been diluted. Given, I have used this product since it first came out(at least 2 years ago IIRC), and the recent stock (Dec 2017 onwards) seems to be lacking in quality.

The previous batch worked great. It helped with breakouts caused by external factors and even rashes I get from sweat and hot weather, providing a lot of relief to red, itchy and pus-filled bumps.

Hope Paula Choice will look into this because there should be no change of formula as far as I am aware of and hope Paula choice will continue producing this product because it's a good product."
CLEAR ACNE BODY SPRAY 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),3,"WORKS WELL, BUT THE SMELL..","Good product but the smell is just awful. I know PC doesn't use fragrance but this doesn't smell great after the shower, and somewhat different from the BHA face lotion."
CLEAR ACNE BODY SPRAY 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),3,IT WAS OKAY,"It really didn`t do much for me. It was okay, it reduced my acne by a bit but other than that nothing much."
CLINICAL ULTRA-RICH SOOTHING BODY BUTTER,5,VERY CREAMY,"I have a very dry patch of skin that itches and is stripped of all moisture right after a shower. This product instantly saves it without me having to apply large amounts of it.

In fact I even brought it with me on holiday because overseas the air is dry."
EXTRA CARE NON-GREASY SUNSCREEN SPF 50,5,LIGHT AND NON GREASY,Great protection without that greasy feeling.
EXTRA CARE NON-GREASY SUNSCREEN SPF 50,5,A GREAT EVERYDAY SUN-BLOCK IF YOU WORK OUTDOORS!,"This is the only sunblock I've used that never makes me break out! Its super breathable and non greasy, and the texture is similar to a light moisturizer- great for sensitive skin. It also works well under make up, and helps the foundation last longer.

Cost effective, lasted a long time"
PERFECT CLEANSING OIL,2,BROKE ME OUT,"I am always on the look out for a cleansing oil of good value. Be sure to check the ingredient list. Unfortunately it broke me out, so I used the rest of the product to wash my make up brushes."
PERFECT CLEANSING OIL,3,GOOD MAKEUP REMOVER,Fragrance free and a blend of great oils. However all of it gets washed off if you second cleanse so cant recommend the high price.
CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,5,CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,Good and mild for my skin
CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,3,GOOD BUT PRICEY,It's a gentle cleanser good for problematic skin but very expensive.
CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,4,A MILD CLEANSER,"I have been using this cleanser for as long as I remember. It washes clean(though a substantial amount is required) and I like that it leaves no soapy residue nor leave my skin too stripped or dry. This cleanser is very good for blemish prone skin as it is gentle and does its purpose of cleansing well without being harsh on sensitive skin.
However, I'm not sure why the description says that there is salicylic acid inside, because it doesn't, and even if it does, salicylic acid in cleanser is a waste of money because it washes off and can't perform its supposed exfoliating function."
CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,5,BEST CLEANSER,A little amount goes a long way therefore I don't really have to top up on the cleanser (when I purchase the full set). Love it!!! Leaves a nice fresh feeling after wash and not greasy fast after.
CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,4,GOOD CLEANSER,I bought this sample size and it lasted me about 2 and a half weeks. A little goes a long way. It helps with reducing and shrinking acne and pores. Not bad for a facial cleanser. I used this in tandem with Grandpa's Thylox soap and it's da bomb!
SKIN RECOVERY SOFTENING CREAM CLEANSER,4,GREAT FOR WINTER,This was great for my combination skin during winter when I was living in temperature countries! Imagine this would work well for drier skins in warmer climates.
SKIN RECOVERY SOFTENING CREAM CLEANSER,5,DEFINITELY REPURCHASE,Been using this for the longest time. Lost count of how many bottles I have bought. It does not dry out my skin nor leave it red like the Resist cleanser. Cleans off sunscreen well.
SHINE STOPPER INSTANT MATTE FINISH,5,THE BEST MATTIFIER!,Benefit Porefessional has nothing on this. This one completely stops oil and leaves your skin looking soft and matte for a long time.

SHINE STOPPER INSTANT MATTE FINISH,4,WORKS FOR OILY SKIN,This has helped my oily and shiny skin for a couple hours. I still need to blot though. But it helps it keep it at bay. Highly recommneded except it stains white residue on clothes.
SHINE STOPPER INSTANT MATTE FINISH,4,OIL ABSORBER,"helped to absorb excess oil , good to offset the oily grease for oily skin."
RESIST ANTI-AGING SERUM FOUNDATION - MATTE,2,STICK TO SKINCARE,Colour shades are not great and leaves a grey cast. Supposed to be moisturising but skin feels dry.
LIP & BODY TREATMENT BALM,2,DUD AND OVERPRICED LIP BALM,"One of the rare Paula's Choice items that didn't work for me.

MOISTURE BOOST ONE STEP FACE CLEANSER,4,EFFICIENT CLEANSER,"I have very oily skin, which I double cleanse with a cleansing oil 1st, then the Moisture Boost with the Clarisonic.
It works very well with the Clarisonic as it foams and feels really clean after that.
But I do find that it can get a little drying, so have been alternating this with the Resist cleanser."
MOISTURE BOOST ONE STEP FACE CLEANSER,5,MY HOLY GRAIL,A daily essential for my combination skin. Can't live without it!
MOISTURE BOOST ONE STEP FACE CLEANSER,5,A TASKMASTER!,"I have combination skin but this works like a gem in cleansing gently all the oil and gunk at the end of the day, regardless of the seasons. I have used this for years and have not found a more efficient cleanser! Highly recommended!"
MOISTURE BOOST ONE STEP FACE CLEANSER,5,GENTLE CLEANSER..GREAT FOR COMBINATION SKIN TOO,This cleanser has a creamy lotion texture that works very well with my combination skin. It adds moisture to my skin and is very gentle. I could rub my face the whole day without any irritation.
SKIN RECOVERY ENRICHED CALMING TONER,5,GREAT CALMING TONER,"I have got really dry skin most of the time which acts up a week before my period. This toner is not only non irritating to my sensitive skin but helps to calm it down, giving a clean surface before my next few steps (serum.. moisturiser)!"
SKIN RECOVERY ENRICHED CALMING TONER,4,REVIEW,Has been using this toner for a while and it helps to remove leftover dirts after facial cleansing

HYDRALIGHT ONE STEP FACE CLEANSER,4,RECOMMENDED!,My go to for extra oily days - I have combination skin.
HYDRALIGHT ONE STEP FACE CLEANSER,5,LOVE IT,"I have a combination skin. And I've used so many cleansers over the years and always had to switch. My surface skin dries out no matter how mild the cleanser is and causes clogged pores. This cleanser however does a good job of cleaning my skin without drying it out as much. Only issue is that with a combiation skin, my forehead and cheeks continue to get oily faster. I just use a clay mask on these areas once a week to clear hen abit more throughly while keeping the other areas away from too deep a cleanse. Love this product overall."
POWER COUPLE: RESIST C15 & SKIN BALANCING ANTIOXIDANT SERUM,5,GREAT VALUE,Terrific set and cheaper than buying individually.
SKIN BALANCING OIL-ABSORBING MASK,3,BOUGHT THE WHOLE TUBE TO TRY,"for the pore reducing effect and also for my oily skin.
I feel a slight tinging while using it and it was quite difficult to wash off. I did not finish the entire tube.
It is a normal mask, but it did not work for me in what I wish it would(reduce pore size and oiliness of skin)."
SKIN BALANCING OIL-ABSORBING MASK,4,GOOD MASK FOR OILY SKIN!,My favourite PC mask to help clear skin while maintaining moisture.
SKIN BALANCING OIL-ABSORBING MASK,3,JUST OK,It does help combat the oiliness (I have combination skin) but not great in eliminating the gunk.
SKIN BALANCING OIL-ABSORBING MASK,4,GOOD IN ABSORBING MOISTURE,"helps in cleaning skin well, skin feels soft without tightening effect, tried the sample."
SKIN BALANCING ULTRA-SHEER DAILY DEFENSE SPF 30,4,BETTER THAN AVERAGE,Really like the consistency and the sheen it leaves on the skin after application. No reactions. Only wish that the spf was higher for a country like mine.
SKIN BALANCING ULTRA-SHEER DAILY DEFENSE SPF 30,5,OILY AND ACNE PRONE SKIN WILL LOVE THIS!,My skin will be super greasy a few hours just after make up. Most of the moisturizer + sunscreen i have used are often sticky and tends to break me out. This is the best i have found! No oily or sticky residue after application. And controls oil pretty well for up to 6-7 hours which i only have to blot off oil only once a day at work instead of multiple times! So glad i found this!
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH ESSENTIAL KIT,3,NOT DRYING,"I have pimples on my neck now that I’m in my mid-30s. In the past, when I used a drugstore pimple cream,my neck got really dry (almost scaly) and itchy! This is not the case with Paulas Choice Acne Kit. It cleared up the pimples without drying my neck! Will buy the extra strength one for my face next time because I think the pimples on my face need more “work”."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH ESSENTIAL KIT,5,BEST SKINCARE KIT,Bought the trial version then proceeded to purchase the full kit. I seldom repurchase skincare but I do it for this set! Much more worth it and also works well on my sensitive acne skin!
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH ESSENTIAL KIT,5,HAPPY,"this is by far the best acne kit i ever had.its a repeated purchase.i had adult acne for the past one year and got recommended to this and i was beyond satisfied!!i do have dry face after washing,oily in the day and acne prone.ever since using this,my acne have gone down ALOT and i dont get acne anymore.i only get pimples ard the time of the month but will subside after 1day of using the daily treatment cream.not gonna turn to other products .i see myself using this kit for a long run!..:)hope it will not be discontinued or i'll be saddest person in the world!"
CLEAR ACNE BODY SPRAY 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),4,USED TO BE GOOD BUT,"recently, the few bottles which I received smelled different and feels different I feel like the thing has been diluted. Given, I have used this product since it first came out(at least 2 years ago IIRC), and the recent stock (Dec 2017 onwards) seems to be lacking in quality.

The previous batch worked great. It helped with breakouts caused by external factors and even rashes I get from sweat and hot weather, providing a lot of relief to red, itchy and pus-filled bumps.

Hope Paula Choice will look into this because there should be no change of formula as far as I am aware of and hope Paula choice will continue producing this product because it's a good product."
CLEAR ACNE BODY SPRAY 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),3,"WORKS WELL, BUT THE SMELL..","Good product but the smell is just awful. I know PC doesn't use fragrance but this doesn't smell great after the shower, and somewhat different from the BHA face lotion."
CLEAR ACNE BODY SPRAY 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),3,IT WAS OKAY,"It really didn`t do much for me. It was okay, it reduced my acne by a bit but other than that nothing much."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,3,ABIT STRONG,"Be careful when using, slightly strong for sensitive skin"
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,4,HMM,"Love-hate relationship with this. It takes some time for it to be fully absorbed after application. It also makes my skin feels very tight after. However, it did calm my breakouts very well along with the rest of the products."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,2,DIDNT WORK,"increased breakouts, prefer the drugstore version for regular use."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,5,THIS ALWAYS WORKS! MY HOLY GRAIL FOR PIMPS,"This always works on my zits, red bumps or those with heads. Usually, after applying after once or twice on headless red bump, the whitehead will be ripen and it is ready for extraction. Do note that this can may dry peeling skin (if you apply too frequent) so may sure you apply moisturiser or serum on that area before you apply this. Just a dab of this will do and remember to apply sunscreen if you are using in the day."
CALM REPAIRING SENSITIVE SERUM,3,DIDN’T SHOW MUCH EFFECT,"I used a few sample sachets of this whenever I had extremely sensitive skin from using the 2% BHA, 1% retinol and 15% Vit C. But it didn’t do anything to calm my super sensitive skin down. So I did not buy the full size. Maybe it is just my overly sensitive skin."
CALM REPAIRING SENSITIVE SERUM,4,GOOD FOR OILY SENSITIVE SKIN,"Gets absorbed very fast in the skin, not moisturising, helped in reducing/fading the redness."
CALM REPAIRING SENSITIVE SERUM,3,GOOD,Good
CALM REPAIRING SENSITIVE SERUM,3,UNDERWHELMING,Leaves a sheen on my face despite being fully absorbed. My face tingles a little if I don't follow up with a moisturiser immediately. Does not appear to help much with calming down my irritated skin too.
CALM SENSITIVE DAYTIME MOISTURIZER SPF 30 (NORMAL / DRY),4,DOES WHAT IT SAYS,I got sample sizes from a friend and this actually works wonders. Gives a matte finish and good for under make up
CALM SENSITIVE DAYTIME MOISTURIZER SPF 30 (NORMAL / DRY),3,GOOD,Good
CALM REPAIRING SENSITIVE SERUM,3,DIDN’T SHOW MUCH EFFECT,"I used a few sample sachets of this whenever I had extremely sensitive skin from using the 2% BHA, 1% retinol and 15% Vit C. But it didn’t do anything to calm my super sensitive skin down. So I did not buy the full size. Maybe it is just my overly sensitive skin."

CALM REPAIRING SENSITIVE SERUM,3,GOOD,Good
CALM REPAIRING SENSITIVE SERUM,3,UNDERWHELMING,Leaves a sheen on my face despite being fully absorbed. My face tingles a little if I don't follow up with a moisturiser immediately. Does not appear to help much with calming down my irritated skin too.
CALM SENSITIVE DAYTIME MOISTURIZER SPF 30 (OILY / COMBINATION),4,GOOD FOR BREAKOUT-PRONE SKIN,"This is by far the best mineral-based moisturizer, next to my all-time favourite Resist Superlight tinted one. I use this when not at work. Feels quite runny at first but it does 'matte' out in a while. What I like is that it doesn't cause breakouts and can easily be applied on anytime & anywhere. It does have a slight whitish tint and stings the eye when sweating. Hopefully PC can develop a mineral-based sunscreen which is more waterproof. Still will recommend this product to others!"
CALM SENSITIVE DAYTIME MOISTURIZER SPF 30 (OILY / COMBINATION),4,WORKS FINE FOR ME,"i had dry face after washing,oily in the day.eventho after putting on,it appears to be abit only but have a healthy 'glow' to it.i stick to it cause it doesnt cause any breakouts!im fine with blotting my face once a day rather than twice last time.its definitely controlling my oils.:)"
RESIST OPTIMAL RESULTS HYDRATING CLEANSER,4,GENTLE CLEANSER THAT IS GD FOR DEHYDRATED SKIN,"I have really oily skin with dehydrated surface, so I used to use the Moisture Boost cleanser, but when I found that too be slightly drying after cleansing , I decided to try this out.
The trick really is to massage the cleanser onto your face 1st, then go over again with a bit of water, before rinsing everything off. Feels like it’s cleaner that way.
Skin doesn’t feel tight after cleansing, but I only use it once a day as I find it is a little pricey, so I alternate this with Moisture Boost cleanser.
But if you have dry skin, I think it is worth to invest in."
RESIST OPTIMAL RESULTS HYDRATING CLEANSER,5,FAVOURITE MORNING CLEANSER,The best morning cleanser ive tried. Not great at removing makeup so use it am. Does not strip skin and leaves a lovely plumped feeling on skin. Love it
RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,5,I BOUGHT 2 SACHETS FIRST..,".. and loved the texture and how it suck into my skin and made me look well rested the next morning, no irritation as usual as with the rest of PC products, going to order a full size!"
RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,5,RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,"Of all the serums, i like this one best. Absorbs well, Not oily. Effective. Moisturising to a certain extent. I like the texture."
RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,5,MY FAVOURITE,"I use this every night after toner, before moisturiser. On my 40 year old skin, this is soothing, calming and moisturising enough and gives me a glow the next morning. A must have."
RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,4,BROKE ME OUT,"Tried this and I've no doubt the ingredients are fantastic, but it's perhaps too heavy for me, made me break out. Prefer the ultra light serum."
RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,5,GLAD TO TRY,I like to use it on the night routine as it really helps to improve complexion. Face glowing on the next morning.
RESIST ADVANCED SMOOTHING TREATMENT 10% AHA (GLYCOLIC ACID),4,STRONGER THAN I PREFERRED BUT EFFECTIVE,I tried this to try and get more even skin tone on my face and neck. It was a little too strong so I eventually settled on the 4% version. But it was effective especially the first time I tried it. It may be useful for those who have tried the 4% and want something stronger.
RESIST ADVANCED SMOOTHING TREATMENT 10% AHA (GLYCOLIC ACID),1,BROKE ME OUT,Thought to use this in combination with the 1% BHA but it broke me out.
RESIST PERFECTLY BALANCED FOAMING CLEANSER,3,"GOOD, NOT GREAT","It's a nice enough cleanser but honestly, good ingredients don't have time to penetrate the skin when you wash is away so I would spend my money on other skincare."
RESIST PERFECTLY BALANCED FOAMING CLEANSER,3,OKAY CLEANSER,Would recommened the resist hydrating cleanser over this. Skin balancing cleanser is a better value for money and i feel works similar to this.
RESIST PERFECTLY BALANCED FOAMING CLEANSER,4,GOOD CLEANSER,"Leaves the skin feeling refreshed, and effectively removes make up, slightly drying if use too much."
RESIST PERFECTLY BALANCED FOAMING CLEANSER,4,EXCELLENT CLEANSER,This cleanser left my skin feel less oily and refresh
RESIST PERFECTLY BALANCED FOAMING CLEANSER,5,"EXCELLENT, NON-STRIPPING CLEANSER",This cleanser left my skin feeling smooth and clean without being overly stripped. I don't think it's sufficient to remove make-up however. Would definitely buy again.
RESIST YOUTH-EXTENDING DAILY HYDRATING FLUID SPF 50,4,RESIST YOUTH-EXTENDING DAILY HYDRATING FLUID SPF 50,This is my go-to daily moisturiser. It is light and there are no white cast on skin. It is not oil and heavy. I like it that it has spf 50.
RESIST YOUTH-EXTENDING DAILY HYDRATING FLUID SPF 50,5,MY FAVOURITE MOISTURISER,"I use this daily - smooth, clear skin and no breakouts!"
RESIST YOUTH-EXTENDING DAILY HYDRATING FLUID SPF 50,5,"MY DAILY MOISTURIZER, GREAT WITH MAKEUP",I wear this daily under makeup and it's super light and skin feels lovely. I live in the tropics and sunscreen works very well!
RESIST YOUTH-EXTENDING DAILY HYDRATING FLUID SPF 50,3,GLOW,I used acne clear n tot of changing but it’s as not mattifying as the clear acne...
RESIST YOUTH-EXTENDING DAILY HYDRATING FLUID SPF 50,4,LIKED IT,I like this one! I really don`t have anything bad to say about it just that the tube and package design. I wished they used the other type.
PC4MEN ESSENTIAL KIT,5,COMPREHENSIVE,"a good comprehensive kit. i personally liked the shaving cream, sooth + smooth and the night time repair!"
PC4MEN SOOTHE + SMOOTH TREATMENT 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),5,MY HOLYGRAIL BHA PRODUCT FOR AFTER SHAVING!,"This is my favourite BHA product from paula for preventing breakouts and ingrown hair (after shaving on face or body). It's texture is very light weight, just like a toner and it is not irritating/ doesn't leave a film like it's original BHA liquid. I would always keep this product in my skincare arsenal!"
PC4MEN SOOTHE + SMOOTH TREATMENT 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),5,NON-IRRITABLE,"Unlike other BHA products which I have used before, it gives minimum tingling sensation or discomfort upon application"
PC4MEN LIP BALM SPF 50,5,BEST LIP BLAM FOR DAY TIME,"I have used up quite a few of this lip blam for day time use now. It doesn't have a white cast, don't look too glossy and keeps your lips hydrated and protected from the sun. My go to product for my lips in the day time!"
PC4MEN LIP BALM SPF 50,3,IT IS WHAT IT IS,it felt like any other lip balm i've used
CALM SENSITIVE 1% BHA LOTION,5,GENTLE BUT EFFECTIVE!,"This did not irritate my highly sensitive skin but made it clearer and kept clogged pores at bay. I started with this nightly, and then now I rotate it with the 2% lotion. I will definitely repurchase."
CALM SENSITIVE 1% BHA LOTION,5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,Effective keeping at bay PMS related breakouts - I use it every night under moisturiser.
CALM SENSITIVE 1% BHA LOTION,3,GOOD FOR SENSITIVE SKINS,"I have tried this, it works fine and it is a gentle exfoliant. As to reduce redness, I saw a bit of difference but not too much. Overall, I think this would suit very sensitive skin types."
CALM SENSITIVE 1% BHA LOTION,5,AMAZING,"Love the formula and the texture of this products

I was traveling in Europe for a month and this kept my skin problem free and also calms my skin down !"
CALM SENSITIVE 1% BHA LOTION,1,DOES NO DIFFERENCE AS COMPARED TO SKIN PERFECTING 1% BHA LOTION EXFOLIANT,"I was previously using the Skin Perfecting 1% BHA Lotion Exfoliant before this calm series was released as a better version.
There is no positive outcome from using this product, and it is unfortunate that the Skin Perfecting 1% BHA Lotion Exfoliant has been replaced by this."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH TRAVEL KIT,3,HANDY TRAVEL PACK,"My first time trying Paula's Choice. The acne cleanser was calm and soothing, no stings or burning feeling for my sensitive skin. 2% exfoliator may be a little too strong for my skin hence I may change to 1% BHA calm sensitive. The blemish treatment dries acne the very next day, pretty effective."
PC4MEN SOOTHE + SMOOTH TREATMENT 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),5,MY HOLYGRAIL BHA PRODUCT FOR AFTER SHAVING!,"This is my favourite BHA product from paula for preventing breakouts and ingrown hair (after shaving on face or body). It's texture is very light weight, just like a toner and it is not irritating/ doesn't leave a film like it's original BHA liquid. I would always keep this product in my skincare arsenal!"
PC4MEN SOOTHE + SMOOTH TREATMENT 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),5,NON-IRRITABLE,"Unlike other BHA products which I have used before, it gives minimum tingling sensation or discomfort upon application"
RESIST BHA 9 (SALICYLIC ACID),4,GENTLE FOR SUCH A STRONG PRODUCT,High concentration of BHA yet just gives a little bit tingling. It is too pricy for the small volume. And the pump needs improvement as the liquid leaks.
RESIST BHA 9 (SALICYLIC ACID),4,STRONG PRODUCT,"Works well in reducing my headless pimples. But it is strong, so next day my skin tends to flake and makeup is difficult to apply. Not for daily use but good for clearing blemishes"
RESIST BHA 9 (SALICYLIC ACID),4,EFFECTIVE ON SMALL SKIN TAGS,I tried it on very small tags that cropped up on my neck. The BHA removes these effectively over a period of several weeks. Surprised but pleased that this could be used for this.
RESIST BHA 9 (SALICYLIC ACID),3,TOO DRYING,"I wish I loved this product, as I love the other BHA products. But this is really too drying for me, making it hard to conceal blemishes with make-up the next day."
RESIST BHA 9 (SALICYLIC ACID),5,SHOULD GIVE MORE THAN 5 STAR RATING,one of the best night care solution for aging skin. loving it.
RESIST SUPER-LIGHT DAILY WRINKLE DEFENSE SPF 30,5,GREATEST. SUNSCREEN. EVER.,"I didn't believe sunscreens could be physical, non greasy and be alcohol free, until i met this. Theres literally no other product like it.
I'm the oiliest person you'll ever meet who has to blot 5 times a day. With this, thats down to 1-2 times. I absolutely love it."
RESIST SUPER-LIGHT DAILY WRINKLE DEFENSE SPF 30,4,NOT PERSPIRATION PROOF BUT A GREAT MINERAL SPF,"This was my go to spf for a long time. I prefer mineral based spf and i love that this is tinted, so no white cast. Its feels light, for a mineral spf. You can still feel it on your skin but it is one of the lightest feeling mineral spf in the market.
My only problem is that its not sweat resistant. To help it stay on, i apply long lasting foundation over it."
RESIST SUPER-LIGHT DAILY WRINKLE DEFENSE SPF 30,5,BEST MOISTURISER I HAVE USED,"I used to have an oily and acne prone skin, change moisturisers a lot before and stuck with this product for more than 2 years.

Pros:
- has a tinted coverage so it evens out the skintone.
- good sunblock with spf so very helpful especially in the morning when I'm about to go to work.
- The 60 ml size could last me for around 4-5 months.

Cons:
- none so far"
RESIST SUPER-LIGHT DAILY WRINKLE DEFENSE SPF 30,5,AWESOME SUNSCREEN EVEN FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,"Great for no makeup day! Love this so much! It has a nice texture and enough colour to hide blemishes. I can live without liquid foundation now, hiak hiak! :D"
RESIST SUPER-LIGHT DAILY WRINKLE DEFENSE SPF 30,5,GREAT ON NO MAKEUP DAYS!,"I love this for the weekend, it has a nice texture and a tint that gives enough colour to even out skin and hide blemishes/scars. The tone is a little ashy, I wish there were more colours to choose from but overall excellent product!"
ALL OVER HAIR & BODY SHAMPOO,3,"SADLY,","I think Paula Choice is really an expert brand in terms of skin care, but not so much for hair care. This shampoo is a very simple shampoo which washes well, and honestly, just like any other normal shampoo out there. I do like that it is not greasy and not too drying as well. Still, there are plenty of shampoo products out there with a much cheaper price tag and which works as well."
ALL OVER HAIR & BODY SHAMPOO,4,FUNCTIONAL,Works for my dry hair. A life saver for overseas travel.
ALL OVER HAIR & BODY SHAMPOO,5,MY FAVORITE!!!,I’ve been struggling to find a fragrance free shampoo for ages! Thank goodness for Paula’s Choice! This shampoo/body wash cleanses my scalp brilliantly without stripping my hair. Its also a great body wash because its a product made with such a clean formula. I’ve stocked up since i discovered this :)
ALL OVER HAIR & BODY SHAMPOO,5,FANTASTIC SHAMPOO FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,"I’ve used 2 bottles and have 3 backups. That how much i love this. It works wonderfully as a shampoo and body wash. It doesn’t dry my hair and dry skin, feels very clean after. This is a very clean formula, i love it. The only con is the price, this stuff is quite expensive but i will continue to use it."
EARTH SOURCED PURELY NATURAL REFRESHING TONER,2,NOT SUITABLE FOR ME,PC's toner doesn't really suit my sensitive skin. I still get the burning sensation once in awhile when my skin gets very sensitive. Love their other products though
PC4MEN BODY WASH,5,GOOD PRODUCT.,I am using this as my daily shampoo. Agree that some may not like as it's scentless. But it's really good. Not sure why but my scalp was very itchy previously... I've tried many other shampoo.. even organic shampoo but still the itch persist. I switch to use this PC4Men and I realised recently that my scalp isn't itchy anymore. Will buy my second bottle soon.
RESIST BARRIER REPAIR MOISTURIZER,3,DIDN’T WORK FOR ME,I have sensitive and dehydrated skin. This made me break out in small tiny bumps. I stopped using it and waited for my skin to clear up before going back to it again. Same thing happened. I wished it worked for me though since the price is reasonable for me. I am using the rest of the remaining product for my neck now.
RESIST BARRIER REPAIR MOISTURIZER,3,TOO RICH FOR ME,"Broke me out. If you have combination skin, try the light blue version instead - that's fantastic."
RESIST BARRIER REPAIR MOISTURIZER,5,VALUE FOR MONEY- AND IT WORKS!,"I used to use the Resist anti-aging hydrator, but found that not moisturising enough, even though I’ve got oily skin.
So I tried the Barrier repair moisturiser, and I can really feel the difference!
I only use it at night, when I wake up, my skin is shiny (in a good way!) and the retinol really helps in quickly reducing the scars from the occasional hormonal outbreaks that I get.
Been using for 2 years and don’t think you’ll be able to find another moisturiser that has retinol in it with such reasonable price."
RESIST BARRIER REPAIR MOISTURIZER,4,GO-TO SERUM,"This is my 2 bottle. I use it before bed as its very light weight but visible moisture on skin, lasts up to 12 hrs of sleep in dry air conditioned room. In a long run baby like skin and no more dark eye bags"
RESIST BARRIER REPAIR MOISTURIZER,5,OILY DEHYDRATED SKIN,"I have sensitive and severely dehydrated skin which causes the skin to appear pretty oily. Contrary to the belief that oily skin types should go for sebum control products, I fixed the root cause instead. This moisturizer doesn’t cause my skin to breakout and it actually helped reduce the shine on my face! I love it!"
CALM REPAIRING SENSITIVE SERUM,3,DIDN’T SHOW MUCH EFFECT,"I used a few sample sachets of this whenever I had extremely sensitive skin from using the 2% BHA, 1% retinol and 15% Vit C. But it didn’t do anything to calm my super sensitive skin down. So I did not buy the full size. Maybe it is just my overly sensitive skin."
CALM REPAIRING SENSITIVE SERUM,4,GOOD FOR OILY SENSITIVE SKIN,"Gets absorbed very fast in the skin, not moisturising, helped in reducing/fading the redness."
CALM REPAIRING SENSITIVE SERUM,3,GOOD,Good
CALM REPAIRING SENSITIVE SERUM,3,UNDERWHELMING,Leaves a sheen on my face despite being fully absorbed. My face tingles a little if I don't follow up with a moisturiser immediately. Does not appear to help much with calming down my irritated skin too.
POWER COUPLE: RESIST C15 & SKIN BALANCING ANTIOXIDANT SERUM,5,GREAT VALUE,Terrific set and cheaper than buying individually.
RESIST ADVANCED REPLENISHING TONER,5,GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,"I have sensitive and dehydrated skin that can get very oily...
I love how this toner doesn’t feel heavy yet it completely alleviates the dryness I feel sometimes, when my skin gets too sensitive to put on moisturiser, yet needed something to soothe the tightness."
RESIST ADVANCED REPLENISHING TONER,4,MOISTURISING!,like how this toner moisturises my skin and does not dry it!
RESIST ADVANCED REPLENISHING TONER,5,GREAT MOISTURIZER FOR OILY SKINS,Love the ingredients. I use this in place of a moisturizer for oily skin. Lotions dont sit well on my skin and feel too sticky. This absorbs well and hydrates. A staple in my skincare routine
RESIST ADVANCED REPLENISHING TONER,5,GREAT TEXTURE,"After not using a toner for a long time, I decided to give this a try... And i’ve not regretted since! It’s got a light but not too watery texture and is very moisturizing."
RESIST ADVANCED REPLENISHING TONER,5,MOISTURIZING TONER,Love the texture! Very moisturizing.
RESIST INTENSIVE REPAIR CREAM WITH RETINOL,3,TRY THE RETINOL TREATMENT INSTEAD,"This one broke me out. If you have combination skin, the dark blue series can cause breakouts. I find it more effective to use the retinol treatment and follow up with the light blue series of moisturiser."
RESIST INTENSIVE REPAIR CREAM WITH RETINOL,5,AWESOME GIFT FOR MOTHER'S DAY,I bought this for my mum and she absolutely loved it. It's lightweight and really helped to smoothe out wrinkles. A little goes a long way.
RESIST INTENSIVE REPAIR CREAM WITH RETINOL,4,VERY GOOD,This is great as a eye cream. My mum has dry skin and it is absorbed very fast to provide instant hydration. Skin looks more well rested after using it.
RESIST ANTI-AGING CLEAR SKIN HYDRATOR,4,GOOD MOISTURIZER,I like the matte feel but expect more antioxidants.
RESIST ANTI-AGING CLEAR SKIN HYDRATOR,5,MY FAVOURITE MOISTURISER,"I love this! It provides great moisture and smooth skin without breaking me out. However, it's a little thick - try it first if you don't like the feeling of silicone."
RESIST ANTI-AGING CLEAR SKIN HYDRATOR,3,"SLIGHTLY DRYING, EVEN FOR OILY SKIN","I found this moisturiser to be quite drying, even though I have oily skin, and this is under the oily skin range. Changed to the barrier repair moisturiser and never looked back ;)"
RESIST ANTI-AGING CLEAR SKIN HYDRATOR,1,GAVE ME CYSTIC ACNE,Tried it first time. Gave me pimples. After a few weeks. I gave it a try again and I had cystic acne on my cheek. I have oily and acne prone. Disappointed
RESIST ANTI-AGING CLEAR SKIN HYDRATOR,2,PACKAGING CAN BE IMPROVED,"didnt like the pump packaging as it was hard to dispense the product. also did not work for me, my skin broke out a little."

CALM SENSITIVE TONER (OILY / COMBINATION),4,GOOD TO CALM SKIN,Been using and works for sensitive skin
CALM SENSITIVE TONER (OILY / COMBINATION),3,IT IS AN AVERAGE TONER,"I have been using this for awhile. I like it to be honest. It is gentle, refreshes my skin and is good for winter times and dry weather, very calming and that is why I have kept using it. As to do wonders, no it won't. It is just a very good average toner!"
CALM SENSITIVE TONER (OILY / COMBINATION),3,CALM SENSITIVE TONER,Tried the sachets for trial. It was pretty calming and gentle for my sensitive skin. No burning sensation.
GENTLE TOUCH MAKEUP REMOVER,2,STICKING TO MY USUAL MAKEUP REMOVER,"Unfortunately, a little too gentle for me. And I do not wear heavy makeup."
GENTLE TOUCH MAKEUP REMOVER,5,GENTLE AND DOES ITS WORK,Have been using many bottles of it. It's gentle like it claims and non-drying to the skin. I have combination and sensitive skin
GENTLE TOUCH MAKEUP REMOVER,5,LOVE IT,"It removes makeup easily, cleanses my skin, removes my eye make-up lip and face with not much effort. It actually got into my eye and I was surprised that it didn`t burn it! I definitely recommend it. It is oily but the oil absorbs and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and clean."
PC4MEN NIGHTTIME REPAIR,5,GOOD,It's easy to apply and absorb well.
PC4MEN NIGHTTIME REPAIR,5,BOYFRIEND LOVES IT,Bought this for my boyfriend. At first he found it a bit pricey but now he likes it so much he's getting a second tube! Personally think it's worth the money because it's a well-rounded product with a whole bunch of other great ingredients in there that you won't find in other cheaper moisturisers.
RESIST WEIGHTLESS ADVANCED REPAIRING TONER,3,"GOOD, NOT GREAT","Toner is one of those items I don't feel you need to splurge on. This one is nice and gentle on skin, but there are cheaper alternatives."
RESIST WEIGHTLESS ADVANCED REPAIRING TONER,5,ANOTHER HOLYGRAIL FROM PC!,"This toner is lightweight, choke full of antioxidants and irritants and feels really good on my skin in tropical Singapore weather. Try it if your have oily/combination skin type. I find that it helps with my pore size and shine throughout the day. Definitely repurchasing this once it runs out!"
RESIST WEIGHTLESS ADVANCED REPAIRING TONER,5,DOES WHAT IT SAYS!,"IT is great, it unclogs, smoothes out your skin! It is gentle and it does its work."
RESIST WEIGHTLESS ADVANCED REPAIRING TONER,5,SATISFY!,Light weight & easy to absorb. No any irritation at all. This is the best skin care I’ve ever use (I use together with others product from the same series) for my clogged pore skin which follow me so many years. Going to have the next bottle soon.
RESIST WEIGHTLESS ADVANCED REPAIRING TONER,4,BEST TONER SO FAR,"Gentle and quick absorbing with great restoring ingredient, it prevents my pores from getting any bigger after 8 months of using it. This is my second purchase and will further purchase it in future."
SKIN BALANCING OIL-ABSORBING MASK,3,BOUGHT THE WHOLE TUBE TO TRY,"for the pore reducing effect and also for my oily skin.
I feel a slight tinging while using it and it was quite difficult to wash off. I did not finish the entire tube.
It is a normal mask, but it did not work for me in what I wish it would(reduce pore size and oiliness of skin)."
SKIN BALANCING OIL-ABSORBING MASK,4,GOOD MASK FOR OILY SKIN!,My favourite PC mask to help clear skin while maintaining moisture.
SKIN BALANCING OIL-ABSORBING MASK,3,JUST OK,It does help combat the oiliness (I have combination skin) but not great in eliminating the gunk.
SKIN BALANCING OIL-ABSORBING MASK,4,GOOD IN ABSORBING MOISTURE,"helps in cleaning skin well, skin feels soft without tightening effect, tried the sample."
CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,3,TOO STRONG FOR ME,"This is too strong for me, i be trying the 1% booster to see if it works for me better. I reduce the frequency to once a week and still get flaking skin. But lower percentage of retinol works so i might stick to that too."
CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,5,IT TAKES TIME BUT SO WORTH IT,"I have very sensitive skin, so it took me a year to ease myself into using the retinol every night. Before, I used it for a night a week and it made my skin peel and skin red and sore for 4 days. I gradually built it up preserving on the thought it will build my collagen. It’s been a year and I really love this retinol. It makes my skin so much younger and glowy. I always mix a pump of it into my moisturizer before applying as this seems to make my skin not react. Sometimes my skin still flakes alittle although I have combination skin, so i use some facial oil and it helps so much."
CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,4,CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,It took me many weeks to get used to the redness and peeling. but i persevered as i see my pores actually become smaller and i break out much less now. My advice is to start slow (once a week) until your skin get sued to it.
CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,2,"TOO DRYING, COULDN'T MAKE IT WORK","I'm sure this is a great product but I couldn't make it work for my skin. It's too drying, no matter how little and sparsingly I use this."
CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,5,RETINOL WITH VIT C,"at times i use this liberally as night cream as i love the texture & the smell as well of an OTC vit a which i can feel gives radiance, plumper skin (makes pores looks smaller) & an overall healthy look to my 40+ yr old skin. I use this on my Retin A off days religiously."
RESIST C15 SUPER BOOSTER,5,CLEARER LOOKING SKIN,i have extraction mark scars on my face. I mix it with my moisturiser & my face looks clearer & brighter. Scar marks are much lighten. I also notice my skin tone is more even.
RESIST C15 SUPER BOOSTER,4,GOOD PRODUCT,"I switched to this from Skinceuticals Phloretin CF as that was so expensive compared to Paula’s Choice Vitamin C. I don’t see my skin getting brighter from using this, nor did it help with a small discoloration I have on my cheek. But I will continue using it since it didn’t break me out as I know vitamin C is good for the skin in the long run"
RESIST C15 SUPER BOOSTER,3,PREFER THE OTHER ANTIOXIDANT SERUMS,"This felt good going on, but caused some dryness and I felt that it irritated my skin a little. I prefer paula’s other antioxidant serums, especially the one for dry skin. It really quenched my 40 year old skin."
RESIST C15 SUPER BOOSTER,4,BRIGHTENS SKIN SIGNIFICANTLY,I love this! A few drops of this at night and I wake up to radiant skin. 4 stars only because it's so pricey for such a small bottle.
RESIST C15 SUPER BOOSTER,3,I HAVE SEEN RAVE REVIEWS,"of this product from many people saying it helped a lot with their brown spots, I decided to give it a shot. And so I bought it and continued using it everyday for at least a few months(because I bought a 2nd and 3rd bottle after the previous bottle ran out).
However, sadly it did nothing for my just one brown spot. Even for spot scars from pimple, this product didn't work for me at all. Plus, it's really expensive and once the color changes to a dark orange, it's time to throw it out.

Nevertheless I give it 3 stars because it did not break me out and I like the smell of this product (no fragrance added, just the smell of the product itself)."
RESIST PURE RADIANCE SKIN BRIGHTENING TREATMENT,5,FANTASTIC PRIMER,"I wanted to buy this but was hesitant due to some of the less-than-stellar reviews here, so I asked for a sample instead. I tried only one sample sachet and was sold. The consistency is quite unusual. It's thick but not silicon-y. After I applied it, it quickly dried to a super smooth texture without even a hint of stickiness (which is a big plus in humid Singapore!) It works like a fantastic primer - my makeup glided on effortlessly, I was just blown away.

The next day, my face seemed clearer and brighter. Still, I waited a few days to make sure I didn't break out. Nope! I placed an order for the full tube and I'm LOVING it. My complexion has never been better and when used under makeup, it gives me a flawless, dewy look."
RESIST PURE RADIANCE SKIN BRIGHTENING TREATMENT,5,GREAT PRIMER,I use it as a primer. Contains mica pigments which impart a slight glow on skin. Love the ceramides in it and sits under makeup well.
CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,3,TOO STRONG FOR ME,"This is too strong for me, i be trying the 1% booster to see if it works for me better. I reduce the frequency to once a week and still get flaking skin. But lower percentage of retinol works so i might stick to that too."

POWER COUPLE: RESIST C15 & SKIN BALANCING ANTIOXIDANT SERUM,5,GREAT VALUE,Terrific set and cheaper than buying individually.
RESIST ADVANCED PORE-REFINING TREATMENT 4% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),5,"A MIRACLE PRODUCT FOR OILY, BLEMISH-PRONE SKIN!","I'm a big fan of the 2% BHA lotion but this product is fantastic as a 3-times weekly exfoliator, or when I have a breakout (then daily). I have super oily skin but this is still too drying if I use it everyday. To clear a breakout, I use this at night, and then gently cleanse my skin with a wet cloth"
RESIST TRAVEL KIT FOR WRINKLES & BREAKOUTS,5,GREAT VALUE,A very good set - no duds here and you get to try all the bestsellers in the series at a lower price.
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH ESSENTIAL KIT,3,NOT DRYING,"I have pimples on my neck now that I’m in my mid-30s. In the past, when I used a drugstore pimple cream,my neck got really dry (almost scaly) and itchy! This is not the case with Paulas Choice Acne Kit. It cleared up the pimples without drying my neck! Will buy the extra strength one for my face next time because I think the pimples on my face need more “work”."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH ESSENTIAL KIT,5,BEST SKINCARE KIT,Bought the trial version then proceeded to purchase the full kit. I seldom repurchase skincare but I do it for this set! Much more worth it and also works well on my sensitive acne skin!
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH ESSENTIAL KIT,5,HAPPY,"this is by far the best acne kit i ever had.its a repeated purchase.i had adult acne for the past one year and got recommended to this and i was beyond satisfied!!i do have dry face after washing,oily in the day and acne prone.ever since using this,my acne have gone down ALOT and i dont get acne anymore.i only get pimples ard the time of the month but will subside after 1day of using the daily treatment cream.not gonna turn to other products .i see myself using this kit for a long run!..:)hope it will not be discontinued or i'll be saddest person in the world!"
CLEAR ACNE BODY SPRAY 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),4,USED TO BE GOOD BUT,"recently, the few bottles which I received smelled different and feels different I feel like the thing has been diluted. Given, I have used this product since it first came out(at least 2 years ago IIRC), and the recent stock (Dec 2017 onwards) seems to be lacking in quality.

The previous batch worked great. It helped with breakouts caused by external factors and even rashes I get from sweat and hot weather, providing a lot of relief to red, itchy and pus-filled bumps.

Hope Paula Choice will look into this because there should be no change of formula as far as I am aware of and hope Paula choice will continue producing this product because it's a good product."
CLEAR ACNE BODY SPRAY 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),3,"WORKS WELL, BUT THE SMELL..","Good product but the smell is just awful. I know PC doesn't use fragrance but this doesn't smell great after the shower, and somewhat different from the BHA face lotion."
CLEAR ACNE BODY SPRAY 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),3,IT WAS OKAY,"It really didn`t do much for me. It was okay, it reduced my acne by a bit but other than that nothing much."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,3,ABIT STRONG,"Be careful when using, slightly strong for sensitive skin"
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,4,HMM,"Love-hate relationship with this. It takes some time for it to be fully absorbed after application. It also makes my skin feels very tight after. However, it did calm my breakouts very well along with the rest of the products."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,2,DIDNT WORK,"increased breakouts, prefer the drugstore version for regular use."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH CREAM 2.5% BP,5,THIS ALWAYS WORKS! MY HOLY GRAIL FOR PIMPS,"This always works on my zits, red bumps or those with heads. Usually, after applying after once or twice on headless red bump, the whitehead will be ripen and it is ready for extraction. Do note that this can may dry peeling skin (if you apply too frequent) so may sure you apply moisturiser or serum on that area before you apply this. Just a dab of this will do and remember to apply sunscreen if you are using in the day."
RESIST HYALURONIC ACID BOOSTER,5,ABSORBS VERY WELL,I mix this with moisturiser. It absorbs very well into my face & it makes my face looks hydrated.
RESIST HYALURONIC ACID BOOSTER,2,WILL NOT REPURCHASE,Finished the whole bottle but it didn’t make a difference in my skin. It didn’t feel moisturizing even though I put moisturizer after using this. I much rather prefer Skinceuticals hydrating B5 gel to this.
RESIST HYALURONIC ACID BOOSTER,2,THERE ARE BETTER PC PRODUCTS,One of the rare PC items I didn't like. Pricey and didn't do anything that the ultra light antioxidant serum couldn't do.
RESIST HYALURONIC ACID BOOSTER,5,HOLY GRAIL!,"I recently came back from a winter holiday in Iceland. Having packed relatively light, I only brought 1 serum on the trip. I applied it day & night for 10 days straight and my skin literally transformed. My skin became so supple and smooth after the trip!"
RESIST HYALURONIC ACID BOOSTER,4,SECOND BOTTLE,I mix this with c-booster and niacinamide booster as a night serum after exfoliant. Works well for me as I don't need a moisturiser. I have combination skin and sleeps with the air-con on.
POWER COUPLE: RESIST C15 & SKIN BALANCING ANTIOXIDANT SERUM,5,GREAT VALUE,Terrific set and cheaper than buying individually.
RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,5,I BOUGHT 2 SACHETS FIRST..,".. and loved the texture and how it suck into my skin and made me look well rested the next morning, no irritation as usual as with the rest of PC products, going to order a full size!"
RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,5,RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,"Of all the serums, i like this one best. Absorbs well, Not oily. Effective. Moisturising to a certain extent. I like the texture."
RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,5,MY FAVOURITE,"I use this every night after toner, before moisturiser. On my 40 year old skin, this is soothing, calming and moisturising enough and gives me a glow the next morning. A must have."
RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,4,BROKE ME OUT,"Tried this and I've no doubt the ingredients are fantastic, but it's perhaps too heavy for me, made me break out. Prefer the ultra light serum."
RESIST SUPER ANTIOXIDANT CONCENTRATE SERUM WITH VITAMIN C,5,GLAD TO TRY,I like to use it on the night routine as it really helps to improve complexion. Face glowing on the next morning.
CLINICAL CERAMIDE-ENRICHED FIRMING MOISTURIZER,4,GOOD SO FAR!,"I've only started using this a few weeks ago but so far so good on my oily, blemish-prone skin! My skin is both oily and dry, which is a pain. I need a night moisturizer that will protect my skin from air conditioning, moisturises, without breaking me out. So far this ticks all the boxes and feels lovely on the skin. My only question mark is that it feels slightly tingly when applying after the BHA 2% lotion, so this may not be good in the long term. But overall good product so far!"
CLINICAL CERAMIDE-ENRICHED FIRMING MOISTURIZER,5,"ABOUT AS THICK AS THE HYDRATOR, VERY MOISTURIZING","This moisturizer is about as thick as the Hydrator, and quite moisturizing. I have normal to combination skin - this one works very well for me. Doesn't clog and some nights i do not use the hyaluronic acid at all. Love it!"
SKIN BALANCING PORE-REDUCING TONER,4,EASY TO USE,"It is lightweight and absorbs quickly. I'm finishing my first bottle, and my skin has been quite clear the past months."
SKIN BALANCING PORE-REDUCING TONER,5,LOCKS IN MOISTURE AND MINIMISES PORES,"This toner is good for prepping my skin for the serum and moisturiser. I love that it is fragrance free, locks in moisture and minimises my pores. Suitable for oily skin."
SKIN BALANCING PORE-REDUCING TONER,5,JUST RIGHT FOR ME,Great toner for combination skin
SKIN BALANCING PORE-REDUCING TONER,5,FINALLY A TONER THAT WORKS,"Hydrating, and filled with beneficial ingredients unlike many toners out there. Noticeable decrease in pore size. Each bottle lasts a long time for me (over 4 months) and I use it 2x a day. Into my second bottle now!"
SKIN BALANCING PORE-REDUCING TONER,4,DOES WHAT IT SAYS,I don`t have much to say about it. It is good! It hydrates and non-irritating.

CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,3,TOO STRONG FOR ME,"This is too strong for me, i be trying the 1% booster to see if it works for me better. I reduce the frequency to once a week and still get flaking skin. But lower percentage of retinol works so i might stick to that too."
CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,5,IT TAKES TIME BUT SO WORTH IT,"I have very sensitive skin, so it took me a year to ease myself into using the retinol every night. Before, I used it for a night a week and it made my skin peel and skin red and sore for 4 days. I gradually built it up preserving on the thought it will build my collagen.

CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,4,CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,It took me many weeks to get used to the redness and peeling. but i persevered as i see my pores actually become smaller and i break out much less now. My advice is to start slow (once a week) until your skin get sued to it.
CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,2,"TOO DRYING, COULDN'T MAKE IT WORK","I'm sure this is a great product but I couldn't make it work for my skin. It's too drying, no matter how little and sparsingly I use this."
CLINICAL 1% RETINOL TREATMENT,5,RETINOL WITH VIT C,"at times i use this liberally as night cream as i love the texture & the smell as well of an OTC vit a which i can feel gives radiance, plumper skin (makes pores looks smaller) & an overall healthy look to my 40+ yr old skin. I use this on my Retin A off days religiously."
RESIST INTENSIVE REPAIR CREAM WITH RETINOL,3,TRY THE RETINOL TREATMENT INSTEAD,"This one broke me out. If you have combination skin, the dark blue series can cause breakouts. I find it more effective to use the retinol treatment and follow up with the light blue series of moisturiser."
RESIST INTENSIVE REPAIR CREAM WITH RETINOL,5,AWESOME GIFT FOR MOTHER'S DAY,I bought this for my mum and she absolutely loved it. It's lightweight and really helped to smoothe out wrinkles. A little goes a long way.
RESIST INTENSIVE REPAIR CREAM WITH RETINOL,4,VERY GOOD,This is great as a eye cream. My mum has dry skin and it is absorbed very fast to provide instant hydration. Skin looks more well rested after using it.
RESIST 25% VITAMIN C SPOT TREATMENT,2,SINCE THE,"C15 vitamin C didn't work for my brown spot, I thought a higher concentration would help, despite the rather crazy price tag for the size.
Sadly, still, I went through nearly two tubes of this, and it did not help at all. I also do not like the white cast it leaves unless I rub the product in, but the instructions say not to rub, so...
However, it does work for other people it seems. Therefore, 3 stars."
RESIST 25% VITAMIN C SPOT TREATMENT,4,UNSURE,"brightening- 100%
fade pimple/acne scars - 100%
dark spot - not yet. am on my first tube. maybe need prolonged usage for spots to fade."
RESIST 25% VITAMIN C SPOT TREATMENT,5,ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE !,It was such an amazing surprise to see how brightened and cleared the applied area and it required just a drop on jaw line
RESIST 25% VITAMIN C SPOT TREATMENT,2,IT STING,"Does not suitable to apply on healing scar as it really sting. However, does not see any result on me."
RESIST 25% VITAMIN C SPOT TREATMENT,4,BRIGHTENING,Helped brighten some stubborn spots over 3months but you need to be consistent with sunscreen. Heavy silicone based treatment so you really only need to tap a small amount over. Doesnt sit undermakeup well will pill if you rub so used at night. Helps control oils if used in am without makeup
REHYDRATING MOISTURE MASK,4,GREAT MOISTURISING MASK!,I have oily skin that gets dry with air-conditioning and with regular blemishes. This works well as a 15-minutes moisture mask when I want my skin to look super smooth before doing my makeup.
PERFECT CLEANSING OIL,2,BROKE ME OUT,"I am always on the look out for a cleansing oil of good value. Be sure to check the ingredient list. Unfortunately it broke me out, so I used the rest of the product to wash my make up brushes."
PERFECT CLEANSING OIL,3,GOOD MAKEUP REMOVER,Fragrance free and a blend of great oils. However all of it gets washed off if you second cleanse so cant recommend the high price.
HYDRALIGHT HEALTHY SKIN REFRESHING TONER,3,JUST BLAH,Not a repeat buy because it did not do anything.
HYDRALIGHT HEALTHY SKIN REFRESHING TONER,5,LIGHT MOISTURISING FOR OFF-DAY AND LAZY DAY,"If you are the one who doesn't like the heavy feeling on the skin, applying this toner could be an option. Buying one for my light day or no makeup day moisturizer."

SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID) LIQUID EXFOLIATOR,5,I'M ON MY 4TH BOTTLE,"If that doesn't say enough, i dont know what will. I have oily acne prone skin and can't go a day without it. It prevent acne for me and keeps my pores free of comedones."
SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID) LIQUID EXFOLIATOR,4,PERFECT SOLUTION FOR ACNE,Paula's Choice has the best solutions for acne. It's gentle yet effectiveness. The only thing is it's very liquidy so can get everywhere. I prefer the gel.
SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID) LIQUID EXFOLIATOR,5,GREAT EXFOLIATOR,"I have a lot of blackhead on my nose, and my friend recommends me to use this product. I tried it and feel my face very clean after using. The essense seems to absorb better too. Definitely recommend this product to others!"
CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,5,CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,Good and mild for my skin
CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,3,GOOD BUT PRICEY,It's a gentle cleanser good for problematic skin but very expensive.
CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,4,A MILD CLEANSER,"I have been using this cleanser for as long as I remember. It washes clean(though a substantial amount is required) and I like that it leaves no soapy residue nor leave my skin too stripped or dry. This cleanser is very good for blemish prone skin as it is gentle and does its purpose of cleansing well without being harsh on sensitive skin.
However, I'm not sure why the description says that there is salicylic acid inside, because it doesn't, and even if it does, salicylic acid in cleanser is a waste of money because it washes off and can't perform its supposed exfoliating function."
CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,5,BEST CLEANSER,A little amount goes a long way therefore I don't really have to top up on the cleanser (when I purchase the full set). Love it!!! Leaves a nice fresh feeling after wash and not greasy fast after.
CLEAR ACNE FACE WASH,4,GOOD CLEANSER,I bought this sample size and it lasted me about 2 and a half weeks. A little goes a long way. It helps with reducing and shrinking acne and pores. Not bad for a facial cleanser. I used this in tandem with Grandpa's Thylox soap and it's da bomb!
RESIST WEIGHTLESS ADVANCED REPAIRING TONER,3,"GOOD, NOT GREAT","Toner is one of those items I don't feel you need to splurge on. This one is nice and gentle on skin, but there are cheaper alternatives."
RESIST WEIGHTLESS ADVANCED REPAIRING TONER,5,ANOTHER HOLYGRAIL FROM PC!,"This toner is lightweight, choke full of antioxidants and irritants and feels really good on my skin in tropical Singapore weather. Try it if your have oily/combination skin type. I find that it helps with my pore size and shine throughout the day. Definitely repurchasing this once it runs out!"
RESIST WEIGHTLESS ADVANCED REPAIRING TONER,5,DOES WHAT IT SAYS!,"IT is great, it unclogs, smoothes out your skin! It is gentle and it does its work."
RESIST WEIGHTLESS ADVANCED REPAIRING TONER,5,SATISFY!,Light weight & easy to absorb. No any irritation at all. This is the best skin care I’ve ever use (I use together with others product from the same series) for my clogged pore skin which follow me so many years. Going to have the next bottle soon.
RESIST WEIGHTLESS ADVANCED REPAIRING TONER,4,BEST TONER SO FAR,"Gentle and quick absorbing with great restoring ingredient, it prevents my pores from getting any bigger after 8 months of using it. This is my second purchase and will further purchase it in future."
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH EXFOLIATING TREATMENT 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),5,FOR PORE CLEANLINESS.,Great daily exfoliant for keeping blackheads at bay. this has a lighter feel vs the liquid BHA if you prefer a lighter texture
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH EXFOLIATING TREATMENT 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),5,GREAT PRODUCT,repurchased this several times for my acne prone skin. works perfectly!
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH EXFOLIATING TREATMENT 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),5,GREAT EXFOLIATOR,My daughter's acnes on the forehead cleared up within a month of using this exfoliator and cleanser. Great product and I have recommended it to my nieces and friends
CLEAR ACNE REGULAR STRENGTH EXFOLIATING TREATMENT 2% BHA (SALICYLIC ACID),1,MAKES SKIN REACTIVE,"BHA 1% is just right while BHA 2% is too strong for my face. It was with the recommendation that I try this product as it is deemed as an in-between. Unfortunately, this product makes my skin active with bumps, and it stings upon application."
RESIST OPTIMAL RESULTS HYDRATING CLEANSER,4,GENTLE CLEANSER THAT IS GD FOR DEHYDRATED SKIN,"I have really oily skin with dehydrated surface, so I used to use the Moisture Boost cleanser, but when I found that too be slightly drying after cleansing , I decided to try this out.
The trick really is to massage the cleanser onto your face 1st, then go over again with a bit of water, before rinsing everything off. Feels like it’s cleaner that way.
Skin doesn’t feel tight after cleansing, but I only use it once a day as I find it is a little pricey, so I alternate this with Moisture Boost cleanser.
But if you have dry skin, I think it is worth to invest in."
RESIST OPTIMAL RESULTS HYDRATING CLEANSER,5,FAVOURITE MORNING CLEANSER,The best morning cleanser ive tried. Not great at removing makeup so use it am. Does not strip skin and leaves a lovely plumped feeling on skin. Love it
HYDRALIGHT SHINE FREE MINERAL COMPLEX SPF 30,3,NOT PERSPIRATION PROOF,"A light lotion consistency, comfortable for my combination skin. However, it does give a small amount of white case, but not too bad. Mineral spf is my preferred spf active, so i’m fine with the tiny bit of white cast.

The main issue i have with this is, it doesn’t stay on if i perspire."
HYDRALIGHT SHINE FREE MINERAL COMPLEX SPF 30,3,NOT REPURCHASING,"Sorry, still too oily to wear alone for my combination skin. Was OK under makeup though."
RESIST 25% VITAMIN C SPOT TREATMENT,2,SINCE THE,"C15 vitamin C didn't work for my brown spot, I thought a higher concentration would help, despite the rather crazy price tag for the size.
Sadly, still, I went through nearly two tubes of this, and it did not help at all. I also do not like the white cast it leaves unless I rub the product in, but the instructions say not to rub, so...
However, it does work for other people it seems. Therefore, 3 stars."

RESIST SMOOTHING PRIMER SERUM SPF 30,4,GREAT IF YOU CAN OVER SILICONE FEELING,"It does glide over pores and make your skin look smooth and silky. However, the silicone texture feels extremely heavy on the skin, and I feel like maybe that clogs pores."
RESIST SMOOTHING PRIMER SERUM SPF 30,1,ONLY WORKS WITH SILICONE FOUNDATION,"I use Estee Lauder (good for oily, scarred skin) and this just doesn't work with it, no matter what I try. I think it's because EEDW is water-based and this is silicone-based. It'd be great if Paula Choice developed a water-based, or at least lighter silicone-based, primer that blends well with more foundation types (like the mineral veil by Hourglass, my favourite but ridiculously expensive)."
