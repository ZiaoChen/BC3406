skin-balancing-invisible-finish-moisture-gel,published,5,Personally my HG moisturiser,Ana,,"I have complicated sensitive/oily/clog-prone skin, and have tried all sorts of products from high-end brands to drugstore ones. l
I apply this day and night to damp skin after cleansing, massage it lightly until it's fully absorbed, and follow it up with organic jojoba oil. My skin feels so supple and baby soft afterwards! I also love the finish, even when layered with makeup.
The tube looks small, but one has personally lasted me 4 months (as mentioned, I apply on damp skin, so it helps on the spreadability, and you really just need a small amount).

I'm really glad I did! Coupled with the moisture gel, my skin feels super moisturised throughout the day and night. Also, a single bottle lasts me forever, and I use like 5-7 drops each time. It's really value for money, and great for my oily, clog-prone sensitive skin too. Not sure about the stinging sensation from the other reviewer, but I use a vitamin c serum (I layer the toner afterwards) so perhaps my skin is used to it.",,2016-12-11 06:31:49 UTC,

A large dark spot on my cheek that i had been struggling to get rid of for years has lightened so much that i cant believe it was ever there! PC products are the best. This serum feels a little oily on the fingers. But once spread on the face, the serum sinks in quickly. I only use this at night. During the day i use a non-retinol serum.",,2016-12-24 15:51:34 UTC,

The ingredient list is perfect, with all the right stuff, but for some reason, this caused bumps to break out on her skin. I tried getting my mum to use this instead, but she also had a huge pimple 3 days after using this. Both of them have usually ""sturdy"" skin that never really break out, but for some reason this cream made them so.

I also use this product on eye area. Unlike ladies, I don't have other mark-ups which may contain SPF. And I am lazy to put on other SPF product area eyes. So I just put this on. So far, it works well. No discomfort thus far.

If you compare on the description careful even, you can see there are not many difference at all for these 2 products  ------ aka, the functions are the same, just some minor ingredients.

The sticky feeling and long time to dry cause a bit inconvenience, particularly in the morning  ---- many follow steps after this BHA, where I don't have much time to spare.

The trick really is to massage the cleanser onto your face 1st, then go over again with a bit of water, before rinsing everything off. Feels like it’s cleaner that way.
Skin doesn’t feel tight after cleansing, but I only use it once a day as I find it is a little pricey, so I alternate this with Moisture Boost cleanser.

- has a tinted coverage so it evens out the skintone.
- good sunblock with spf so very helpful especially in the morning when I'm about to go to work.
- The 60 ml size could last me for around 4-5 months.
