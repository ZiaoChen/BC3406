To find out what is your skin type, wash your face with a gentle cleanser, apply a toner and then wait about 15 to 30 minutes and see how your skin behaves.

If your skin quickly starts showing oil diffused over the face, you have oily skin.

If your skin starts experiencing some dryness and feels tight, you have dry skin.

If your T-zone starts looking oily but your cheeks and jaw area start feeling slightly to moderately dry, you have combination skin. This is the most common skin type because everyone has more oil glands in the center of their face than on their cheeks. #paulaschoicesg",1,0,0

The problems arise when your oil glands make too much oil. #SkincareFacts

This excess oil mixes with other substances (such as dead skin cells) in the pore, causing a clog. Even though the pore enlarges to provide extra room for the oil to flow out, the oil still can become trapped by dead skin cells. Once this occurs and the material (oil and skin cells) at the end of the clogged pore is exposed to the air, it oxidizes, forming a blackhead.
